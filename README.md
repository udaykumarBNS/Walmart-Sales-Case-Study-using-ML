# Walmart-Sales-Case-Study-using-ML
ML-based retail analytics for shipping cost optimization and customer segmentation using Ridge Regression and K-Means.

Machine Learning Project - Walmart US Retail Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Walmart’s US retail dataset to address two key business problems one is shipping cost optimization and the other one is customer segmentation for improved retention. The tech stack included Python and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
The workflow consisted of data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementation of machine learning models including Ridge Regression for predicting shipping costs and K-Means Clustering for segmenting customers, followed by insight generation and actionable business recommendations for the client.
